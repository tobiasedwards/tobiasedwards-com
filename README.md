# tobiasedwards-com
My personal webpage ([tobiasedwards.com](http://tobiasedwards.com)) implemented in node.js.

The idea was originally to just return a JSON representation of my resume so that I had something parked on may domain. I've since decided to have my photo and a mock up of a terminal window with a syntax highlighted version of the JSON response. The JSON is returned at [tobiasedwards.com/?json](http://tobiasedwards.com/?json).

To syntax highligh the mocked up terminal JSON I am using [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) with a modified version of the Tomorrow Night theme.
